JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, functional programming language, 
dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

The script element allows authors to include dynamic script and data blocks in their 
documents. The element does not represents content or the user.

writing the script tag in body part is best practice than writing inside the head block.

web assembly is one of the language which is competator for JavaScript.

If javascript is not supporting then we use noscript. 
The noscript element represents nothing if scripting is enabled, and represents its children if scripting is disabled.
It is used to present different markup to user agents that support scripting and those that don't support scripting, 
by affecting how the document is parsed.

confirm giving two option like ok and cancel.
